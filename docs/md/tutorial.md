# ctest Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is provide a gentle introduction to `ctest`.

When finished, you should feel comfortable writing simple, straightforward unit
tests. You will also be introduced to some of the more advanced features of
`ctest`, although you may not be intimately familiar with them.

Working copies of the examples in this tutorial can be found in the
[`src/examples`](../../src/examples) directory of the distribution. They
are compiled and installed (usually in `/usr/lib/ctest/examples` or
`/usr/local/lib/ctest/examples`) so they can be run without having to write any
code (although following along by writing some code is encouraged).
